->For templete design make folder as templete.

->Inside this templete make html files for the templete as index.html, base.html,update.html.

->Flask provides a fast and easy way for us to serve static files! So building a simple website is a breeze.

->So the html files are needed to build more attractive blog post.

->After this you have to create static folder for css files.

->A CSS file is a cascading style sheet ( CSS) file used to format the contents of a webpage. It contains customized, global properties for how to display HTML elements.

->CSS files can define the size, color, font, line spacing, indentation, borders, and location of HTML elements.

->Then run app.py from your localhost and see the output which you have designed.
