1) Problem Statement:
#->Doing crud operations(create,read,update,delete).
#->Create Posts (with title,body, category etc)
#->Read Posts with a particular post id or if post id is not provided return all the blog posts present in system.
#->Update Posts for particular post id.
#->Delete Posts for a particular post id.

2) How it was solved:
#->Refer to this (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flask/index.htm) website for basics of flask.
#->If you have to learn in easy way then refer vs code.
#->After this you have to create virtual environment.
#->Make one python file as app.py or which you want.
#->For templete design make folder as templete.
#->Inside this templete make html files for the templete as index.html, base.html,update.html.
#->Flask provides a fast and easy way for us to serve static files! So building a simple website is a breeze.
#->So the html files are needed to build more attractive blog post.
#->After this you have to create static folder for css files.
#->A CSS file is a cascading style sheet ( CSS) file used to format the contents of a webpage. It contains customized, global properties for how to display HTML elements. 
#->CSS files can define the size, color, font, line spacing, indentation, borders, and location of HTML elements.
#->Then run app.py from your localhost and see the output which you have designed.
